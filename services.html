  <p><span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> offer a range of services that
    can be customized to meet your needs at every stage of development.</p>
  
  <h3>Software design, architecture and feasibility</h3>
  <p>We can work with you from the earliest stages of your project, helping you
    sketch out design and architectural decisions, investigate technology options,
    or develop a proof of concept. If you’re integrating with one of the
    open-source technologies we support, working with us early in the process can
    be most effective.</p>
  
  <h3>Software development and optimization</h3>
  <p>We can develop full applications or custom libraries to meet your requirements,
    or enhance open-source projects with the features you need. We also work with
    clients on their own code, developing new features, investigating problems,
    and helping to optimize.</p>
  
  <h3>Help, support and maintenance</h3>
  <p>With our support contracts, we’re always on hand to help you, as a source of
    specialist advice, or to deal with urgent problems. We can provide training
    in specific areas, or just save you time in navigating the code and
    documentation of the projects we work with.</p>
