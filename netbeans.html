  <p><a href="https://netbeans.apache.org">Apache NetBeans</a> packages / installers
    provided by Codelerity and Gj IT (see <a href="#who">who we are</a>). These packages
    are built with NBPackage using the official Apache NetBeans binary zip release.
    The packages themselves are not released by the Apache Software Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>These installers include a local Java 17 (LTS) JDK for the IDE to run on,
    offering a self-contained out-of-the-box experience. Additional JDK's for projects
    may be registered and/or downloaded using <code>Tools / Java Platforms</code> in the
    IDE menu, supporting development of projects for Java 8 up to Java 19.</p>
