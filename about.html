  <h2>History</h2>
  <p><span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> was founded by Neil C Smith in
    2019. Neil has over 20 years of experience working with Java technologies.</p>
  
  <p>Neil is a long-term advocate for free and open-source software, and a member
    of the Apache Software Foundation. He develops and contributes to a wide range
    of projects. In particular, he developed
    <a href="https://www.praxislive.org">PraxisLIVE</a>, a radical open-source
    Java live programming environment, about which he regularly talks at
    conferences and user groups.</p>
  
  <p>The technologies in PraxisLIVE form a common thread through the commercial
    services <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> provides, and the company
    continues to support its ongoing development.</p>
